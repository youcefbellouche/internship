/// Stores up to \c requestArraySize requests indexed by slot, each at position

///
/// Producers push requests and a single consumer pops them. Both operations are implemented by the same \ref exchange
/// method: a producer passes a valid resource, the consumer an empty one. Access to the slot resource is guarded by
/// a non-blocking try-lock wrapper. If two threads reach the same slot at once, one proceeds and the other returns
/// without modifying the stored request.
///
/// To allow reporting the slots that are not processed, \ref exchange always returns a request:
/// - On uncontended access it returns the request previously stored at the slot (empty if there was none). A
///   producer overwriting a non-empty request can thus report the overwritten slot (report a 'late').
/// - In the case of a concurrent collision at the exchange, it returns the request that was passed in, so a producer
///   can report its own dropped slot. The consumer passes an empty request, hence a dropped pop simply yields
///   "no request for this slot".
