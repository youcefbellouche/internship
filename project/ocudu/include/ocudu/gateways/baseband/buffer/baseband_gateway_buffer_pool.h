/// \brief Baseband gateway buffer pool definition.
///
/// The baseband gateway buffer pool wraps dynamic buffers in a buffer pool. The pool and its contents are created
/// during the initialization of the application.
///
/// The pool provides a baseband buffer smart pointer type that can be forwarded among different interfaces. When the
/// smart pointer is destroyed, the buffer returns to the pool.
