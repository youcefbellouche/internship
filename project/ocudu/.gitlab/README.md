# Setting Up Your OCUDU Fork

This guide explains how to fork and configure the OCUDU repository to replicate the CI/CD infrastructure in your own GitLab instance.

## 1. Fork the Repository

Create your own copy of this repository to customize it for your development needs:

```bash
# Clone your forked repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/your_user_or_group/ocudu.git
cd ocudu
```

## 2. Choose Your CI/CD Configuration

OCUDU supports three CI/CD modes depending on your requirements:

- **Option A**: Disable CI/CD entirely in GitLab settings (for users not needing automated builds)
- **Option B**: Use basic CI with public images for builders and tools (no customization required)
- **Option C**: Enable complete CI/CD, building your custom images (full control)

### 2.1. Configure CI/CD Variables

OCUDU CI/CD uses two variables to resolve the registry and images it will use:

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `OCUDU_REGISTRY_SERVER` | `registry.gitlab.com` | Container registry server |
| `OCUDU_PROJECT_PATH` | `ocudu/ocudu` | Project path for images |

These variables point to the public OCUDU repository by default. You can override them by creating variables in your project or group.

**Option B - Use Public Images:**

In your GitLab project, go to **Settings → CI/CD → Variables** and add:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `SKIP_OCUDU_BUILDING_CONTAINERS_CI` | `true` |

This uses default public images without building custom ones.

**Option C - Build Custom Images:**

Override the registry variables with your values:

| Variable | Value | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `OCUDU_REGISTRY_SERVER` | Your registry server | `registry.gitlab.com` or `$CI_TEMPLATE_REGISTRY_HOST` |
| `OCUDU_PROJECT_PATH` | Your project path | `your_group/ocudu` or `$CI_PROJECT_PATH` |

You can use [predefined GitLab CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) for dynamic configuration.

### 2.2. Configure the GitLab Project

#### GitOps

OCUDU uses a Terraform/OpenTofu solution to configure the GitLab project itself, including project settings, pipeline schedules, protected branches, approval rules, and more.

**Setup:**

1. Create a CI/CD variable called `GITLAB_TOKEN`:
   - Type: Project Access Token or Personal Access Token
   - Role: `Maintainer`
   - Scopes: `api`, `read_user`, `read_repository`, `write_repository`

2. Modify [.gitlab/main.tf](./main.tf) according to your needs

3. Commit to main branch (via MR or directly)

For more details, see the [terraform module documentation](./ci-shared/gitlab_settings/README.md).

#### Manual Configuration

If you don't create the `GITLAB_TOKEN` variable, GitOps won't be used and you can manage configuration manually.

In that case, check the scheduled pipelines defined at the end of [.gitlab/main.tf](./main.tf) to replicate them manually in your project's **Settings → CI/CD → Schedules**.

### 2.3. GitLab Runners

OCUDU CI/CD is designed to work primarily with GitLab Shared Runners, with options for custom runners when needed.

#### Runner Tags and Usage

Different pipeline types use different runner tags:

| Tag | When Used | Runner Type | Requirements |
|-----|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| (no tag) | All pipelines | Free GitLab Shared Runners | Small tasks, minimal resources |
| `saas-linux-medium-amd64` | MR pipelines & Scheduled pipelines* | Free GitLab Shared Runners | Available to all GitLab users |
| `saas-linux-medium-arm64` | MR pipelines & Scheduled pipelines* | Free GitLab Shared Runners | Available to all GitLab users |
| `avx512` | Scheduled pipelines | Custom Runner | AVX512 instruction set support (typically combined with `saas-linux-large-amd64`) |
| `sctp` | Scheduled pipelines | Custom Runner | SCTP kernel module active (typically combined with `saas-linux-large-amd64` or `saas-linux-large-arm64`) |

> The CI is using `OCUDU_RUNNER_TAG` variable with value `saas-linux-medium` to define the default runner type for OCUDU builds. You can change that variable at group / project level and select other runners in your forked repo. For example, setting `OCUDU_RUNNER_TAG` to `saas-linux-large` will use `saas-linux-large-amd64` / `saas-linux-large-arm64` in all OCUDU build jobs.

#### Default Behavior

- **MR Pipelines**: Work out-of-the-box for all GitLab users using free shared runners
- **Scheduled Pipelines**: Require Premium/Ultimate subscription for most jobs, plus custom runners for specialized features (AVX512, SCTP)

#### Custom Runner Options

You have several options for configuring runners:

**Option 1 - GitLab Shared Runners Only (Default)**

- Enable shared runners in **Settings → CI/CD → Runners**
- Requires Premium/Ultimate for scheduled pipelines
- Some features (AVX512, SCTP) won't be tested because they require custom runners

**Option 2 - Custom Runners Only**

- Disable GitLab shared runners
- Set up your own on-premise or cloud runners with matching tags:
  - `saas-linux-medium-amd64` and/or `saas-linux-medium-arm64` for MR pipelines
  - `saas-linux-large-amd64` and/or `saas-linux-large-arm64` for scheduled pipelines
  - `avx512` for jobs requiring AVX512 instruction set
  - `sctp` for jobs requiring SCTP protocol support
- See [GitLab Runner installation guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/)

**Option 3 - Hybrid (Shared + Custom)**

- Enable both GitLab shared runners and custom runners
- Shared runners handle standard jobs
- Custom runners handle specialized requirements (AVX512, SCTP)
- Best of both worlds: leverage GitLab infrastructure while supporting custom features
